# Weather-website
This project involves building a weather forecast website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will fetch weather data from a third-party API and display the current weather conditions for a specified location. Users will be able to enter the name of their city or zip code to get the latest weather information.

Users can enter the name of their city or zip code into a search bar to retrieve weather data for that location. The website will display the current weather conditions for the specified location, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant information. The background of the website will change based on the current weather conditions, providing a visual representation of the weather. The website will handle errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages if the user enters an invalid location or if there are issues with fetching the weather data from the API. It will be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good and functions correctly on devices of all sizes, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

I will start by researching and selecting a suitable weather API to fetch weather data for the website. I will also outline the structure and layout of the website, including the user interface elements and functionality. I will create the basic structure of the website using HTML, including the necessary elements for the search bar, weather display, and other components. Using CSS, I will style the website, including layout, typography, colors, and visual effects. I will also implement dynamic background changes based on the weather conditions. Using JavaScript, I will implement the functionality to fetch weather data from the selected API, parse the JSON response, and dynamically update the weather display on the website. I will also handle user input validation and error handling. Thorough testing will be conducted on different devices and web browsers to ensure compatibility and usability, including edge cases such as entering invalid locations or handling errors from the API. Once complete and tested, the website will be deployed to a web hosting service and made live for users to access
